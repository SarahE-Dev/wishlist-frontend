One of the first hurdles I ran into was setting up the user slice for authentication with Redux Toolkit. Initially, it was tricky figuring out how to manage the login state and how to persist the user’s token across sessions. Once I got the slice set up, I also had to figure out how to protect certain routes, so users couldn’t access private pages without being logged in. To handle this, I checked if there was a token in localStorage and used a simple redirect to send users to the login page if there wasn’t one. It took a few tries to get it working smoothly, but I eventually got the hang of it.

Another challenge was figuring out how to grab only the wishlists that belonged to the logged-in user. Initially, I was just fetching all the wishlists from the database, which obviously didn’t work when multiple users were involved. I used req.query to send the user’s ID and then modified the backend to return only the wishlists that matched that user. To make that happen, I also had to remember how to do a user reference on the wishlist schema, so the connection between users and their wishlists was solid. I ended up checking the documentation to refresh my memory on how to do that.

For deployment, I deployed the front end on Vercel and the backend on Render. To make it easy to switch between environments, I used an environment variable to store my backend path. This way, I could easily replace the localhost URL with the one Render provided. I also created an Axios instance, which made it seamless to switch between the two.

Lastly, I had a bit of trouble with the priority feature for wishlist items. Originally, I was using strings like “low,” “medium,” and “high,” but I ran into issues when trying to sort them. So, I decided to change the priority to numbers—1 for low, 2 for medium, and 3 for high. This approach worked much better and made sorting a lot simpler.

Oh and also I initially had some trouble connecting to MongoDB Atlas when I switched over to that instead of my local URI, but then I realized I had forgotten to set my network settings to allow access from anywhere.
